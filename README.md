# MMOItems

MMOItems is a complex item solution for minecraft servers which introduces many unique features like damage mitigation, gem stones, item abilities, item deconstruction, soulbound and item identification. MMOItems also features 90 unique item options (tags, stats, display options..) and 70 item abilities.

You can open a ticket on GitHub to write a suggestion. Most of the suggestions I planned on implementing can be seen on the project trello: https://trello.com/b/zu8cubGY/mmoitems

**When reporting an issue, make sure that..**
- you have read the **installation guide** on the wiki.
- the issue is not caused by another plugin. If you think that it is a compatibility issue, try temporarily disabling other plugins and see if it fixes the issue.
- you specify **exactly** how to reproduce the issue. An under-detailed issue will be marked `invalid` till sufficient information is given.
- you include **every** of the MMOItems console logs and other linked logs. If you are unsure of what logs are linked to your issue, just paste the entire server logs using a pastebin. The more information the better.
- you went through your entire server logs (search for the "MMOItems" pattern using a text editor) looking for either **start-up, on-join, or on-load** plugin errors. Plugin issues are often related to these types of errors.
